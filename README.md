## 📌 Project Overview
This project is a **cloud-based note-taking application** designed to provide users with a secure, scalable, and real-time platform for managing personal and collaborative notes. Unlike traditional note-taking tools limited to a single device, this application enables **cross-device synchronization**, **real-time collaboration**, and **secure cloud storage**.

The system is developed using **React.js** for the web platform, **React Native** for mobile applications, and **Firebase** as the cloud backend. It allows users to create, organize, share, and synchronize notes seamlessly across multiple devices.

---

## 🎯 Problem Statement
Existing note-taking solutions often lack:
- Cross-device synchronization
- Real-time collaboration and secure sharing
- Organized categorization and tagging
- Scalable cloud backend infrastructure

As a result, users who require seamless access, collaboration, and synchronization across platforms face limitations with traditional tools.

---

## ✅ Objectives
1. Provide full CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) functionality for notes  
2. Enable categorization and tagging for efficient note organization  
3. Support real-time synchronization across multiple devices  
4. Implement secure authentication and role-based access control  
5. Allow note sharing and collaboration with permission management  
6. Deliver a scalable, lightweight, and cost-efficient cloud-based solution
